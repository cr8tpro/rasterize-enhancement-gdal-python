This can be used for enhancing rasterizing big tiff files from dbf or excel files.

1. First you need to split them into small tif
2. You can do this by rasterizing part fields of dbf file
3. Generate merged mosaic file from small tiff files. 
4. Merge into one big tiff file using python multithreading

PS: Due to lack of time, I couldn't build full script but I will update soon.
